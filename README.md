## Overview

The **World Happiness Report** is an annual report that measures and ranks the happiness levels of countries around the world. It focuses on key factors such as economic conditions, social support, health, and more to evaluate a nationâ€™s well-being.

## Purpose

The main goals of this project are to:
* Visualize the happiness index of countries using Tableau.
* Explore key factors influencing happiness.
* Provide insights into the correlation between happiness and socioeconomic variables.

## Visualizations

The interactive dashboards in this project allow users to:
- Compare happiness scores across countries and regions.
- Analyze the trends of happiness over time.
- Examine how various factors like GDP, social support, and life expectancy contribute to happiness.
- Discover patterns, outliers, and relationships among variables.

## Data Sources
You can find the dataset on the given link [Download Data](https://bit.ly/WHR_15_23)

The data comes from the **World Happiness Report** dataset, which provides:
* Happiness scores for different countries.
* Data on GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

## Key Insights

From the analysis, the following insights were drawn:
- **Countries with higher GDP per capita and stronger social support systems** tend to have higher happiness scores.
- **Life expectancy and freedom** to make life decisions are closely linked to higher happiness.
- **Generosity and perceptions of corruption** show variable effects depending on regional contexts.

## How to Use

To view the visualizations:
1. Download the `.twbx` file from this repository.
2. Open the file using **Tableau Desktop** or **Tableau Reader**.
3. Interact with the dashboards to explore various aspects of the data.

## Future Work

Future improvements and extensions to this project include:
- Expanding the analysis to cover more years of happiness data for long-term trends.
- Incorporating additional datasets like education, healthcare, and political stability.
- Developing predictive models to forecast happiness based on current conditions.

## Conclusion

This project uses Tableau to bring data from the **World Happiness Report** to life, offering insights into the factors that drive happiness around the world. It provides a rich, interactive exploration of the global state of well-being.
